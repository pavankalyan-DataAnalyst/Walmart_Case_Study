# # About Walmart
# 
# * Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.
# 
# 
# # Business Problem
# 
# * The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).
# 
# 

# # Dataset
# 
# * The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday.
# 
# The dataset has the following features:

# ##### Insights
# ##### Outliers
# 
# * There are total of 2677 outliers which is roughly 0.48% of the total data present in purchase amount. We will not remove them as it indicates a broad range of spending behaviors during the sale, highlighting the importance of tailoring marketing strategies to both regular and high-value customers to maximize revenue.
# 
# ##### Distribution
# 
# * Data suggests that the majority of customers spent between 5,823 USD and 12,054 USD, with the median purchase amount being 8,047 USD.
# 
# The lower limit of 12 USD while the upper limit of 21,399 USD reveal significant variability in customer spending

# #### Insights
# * The age group of 26-35 represents the largest share of Walmart's Black Friday sales, accounting for 40% of the sales. This suggests that the young and middle-aged adults are the most active and interested in shopping for deals and discounts.
# 
# * The 36-45 and 18-25 age groups are the second and third largest segments, respectively, with 20% and 18% of the sales. This indicates that Walmart has a diverse customer base that covers different life stages and preferences..
# 
# * The 46-50, 51-55, 55+, and 0-17 age groups are the smallest customer segments, with less than 10% of the total sales each. This implies that Walmart may need to improve its marketing strategies and product offerings to attract more customers from these age groups, especially the seniors and the children.

# 
# * The majority of the customers (49%) have stayed in the current city for one year or less. This suggests that Walmart has a strong appeal to newcomers who may be looking for affordable and convenient shopping options.
# 
# * 4+ years category (14%) customers indicates that Walmart has a loyal customer base who have been living in the same city for a long time.
# 
# * The percentage of customers decreases as the stay in the current city increases which suggests that Walmart may benefit from targeting long-term residents for loyalty programs and promotions.

# ##### Insights
# * Total Sales and Transactions Comparison
# 
# * The total purchase amount and number of transactions by male customers was more than three times the amount and transactions by female customers indicating that they had a more significant impact on the Black Friday sales.
# 
# * Average Transaction Value
# 
# * The average purchase amount per transaction was slightly higher for male customers than female customers (9438 vs 8735).
# 
# * Distribution of Purchase Amount
# 
# * As seen above, the purchase amount for both the genders is not normally distributed.
# 
# # Confidence Interval Construction: 
# 
# ##### Estimating Average Purchase Amount per Transaction
# 
# * Step 1 - Building CLT Curve
# 
# * As seen above, the purchase amount distribution is not Normal. So we need to use Central Limit Theorem. It states the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying population distribution
# 
# * Step 2 - Building Confidence Interval
# 
# * After building CLT curve, we will create a confidence interval predicting population mean at 99%,95% and 90% Confidence level.

# ##### Insights
# * Sample Size
# 
# * The analysis highlights the importance of sample size in estimating population parameters. It suggests that as the sample size increases, the confidence intervals become narrower and more precise. In business, this implies that larger sample sizes can provide more reliable insights and estimates.
# 
# * Confidence Intervals
# 
# * From the above analysis, we can see that except for the Sample Size of 100, the confidence interval do not overlap as the sample size increases. This means that there is a statistically significant difference between the average spending per transaction for men and women within the given samples.
# 
# * Population Average
# 
# * We are 95% confident that the true population average for males falls between 9,393 and 9,483, and for females, it falls between 8,692 and 8,777.
# 
# * Women spend less
# 
# * Men tend to spend more money per transaction on average than women, as the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for men are consistently higher than those for women across different sample sizes.
# 
# 
# ### How can Walmart leverage this conclusion to make changes or improvements?
# 
# * Segmentation Opportunities
# 
# * Walmart can create targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, or product bundles to cater to the distinct spending behaviors of male and female customers. This approach may help maximize revenue from each customer segment.
# 
# # Pricing Strategies
# 
# * Based on the above data of average spending per transaction by gender, they might adjust pricing or discount strategies to incentivize higher spending among male customers while ensuring competitive pricing for female-oriented products.
# 
# * Note
# * Moving forward in our analysis, we will use 95% Confidence Level only.

# #### Insights
# * Sample Size
# 
# * The analysis highlights the importance of sample size in estimating population parameters. It suggests that as the sample size increases, the confidence intervals become narrower and more precise. In business, this implies that larger sample sizes can provide more reliable insights and estimates.
# 
# * Confidence Intervals
# 
# * From the above analysis, we can see that the confidence interval overlap for all the sample sizes. This means that there is no statistically significant difference between the average spending per transaction for married and unmarried customers within the given samples.
# 
# * Population Average
# 
# * We are 95% confident that the true population average for married customers falls between 9,217 and 9,305, and for unmarried customers, it falls between 9,222 and 9,311.
# 
# * Both the customers spend equal
# 
# * The overlapping confidence intervals of average spending for married and unmarried customers indicate that both married and unmarried customers spend a similar amount per transaction. This implies a resemblance in spending behavior between the two groups.
# 
# ###### How can Walmart leverage this conclusion to make changes or improvements?
# ### Marketing Resources
# 
# * Walmart may not need to allocate marketing resources specifically targeting one group over the other. Instead, they can focus on broader marketing strategies that appeal to both groups.

# #### Insights
# * Total Sales Comparison
# 
# * Age group between 26 - 45 accounts to almost 60% of the total sales suggesting that Walmart's Black Friday sales are most popular among these age groups.
# 
# * The age group 0-17 has the lowest sales percentage (2.6%), which is expected as they may not have as much purchasing power. Understanding their preferences and providing special offers could be beneficial, especially considering the potential for building customer loyalty as they age.
# 
# * Average Transaction Value
# 
# * While there is not a significant difference in per purchase spending among the age groups, the 51-55 age group has a relatively low sales percentage (7.2%)but they have the highest per purchase spending at 9535. Walmart could consider strategies to attract and retain this high-spending demographic.
# 
# * Distribution of Purchase Amount
# 
# 
# * As seen above, the purchase amount for all age groups is not normally distributed.
# 
# # Confidence Interval Construction: 
# ### Estimating Average Purchase Amount per Transaction
# * Step 1 - Building CLT Curve
# 
# * As seen above, the purchase amount distribution is not Normal. So we need to use Central Limit Theorem. It states the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying population distribution
# 
# * Step 2 - Building Confidence Interval
# 
# * After building CLT curve, we will create a confidence interval predicting population mean at 95% Confidence level.
# * Note - We will use different sample sizes of [100,1000,5000,50000]

# ### Insights
# 
# * Sample Size
# 
# * The analysis highlights the importance of sample size in estimating population parameters. It suggests that as the sample size increases, the confidence intervals become narrower and more precise. In business, this implies that larger sample sizes can provide more reliable insights and estimates.
# 
# * Confidence Intervals and customer spending patterns
# 
# * From the above analysis, we can see that the confidence interval overlap for some of the age groups. We can club the average spending into following age groups 0 - 17 - Customers in this age group have the lowest spending per transaction 18 - 25, 26 - 35, 46 - 50 - Customers in these age groups have overlapping confidence intervals indicating similar buying characteristics 36 - 45, 55+ - Customers in these age groups have overlapping confidence intervals indicating and similar spending patterns 51 - 55 - Customers in this age group have the highest spending per transaction
# 
# * Population Average
# 
# * We are 95% confident that the true population average for following age groups falls between the below range -
# 
#  * 0 - 17 = 8,888 to 8,979
#  * 18 - 25 = 9,125 to 9,213
#  * 26 - 35 = 9,209 to 9,297
#  * 36 - 45 = 9,288 to 9,376
#  * 46 - 50 = 9,165 to 9,253
#  * 51 - 55 = 9,490 to 9,579
#  * 55+ = 9,292 to 9,381
#  
# # How can Walmart leverage this conclusion to make changes or improvements?
# 
# * Targeted Marketing
# 
# * Knowing that customers in the 0 - 17 age group have the lowest spending per transaction, Walmart can try to increase their spending per transaction by offering them more attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs. Walmart can also tailor their product selection and marketing strategies to appeal to the preferences and needs of this age group
# 
# * Customer Segmentation
# 
# * Since customers in the 18 - 25, 26 - 35, and 46 - 50 age groups exhibit similar buying characteristics, and so do the customers in 36 - 45 and 55+, Walmart can optimize its product selection to cater to the preferences of these age groups. Also, Walmart can use this information to adjust their pricing strategies for different age groups.
# 
# * Premium Services
# 
# * Recognizing that customers in the 51 - 55 age group have the highest spending per transaction, Walmart can explore opportunities to enhance the shopping experience for this demographic. This might involve offering premium services, personalized recommendations, or loyalty programs that cater to the preferences and spending habits of this age group.

# # Recommendations
# 
# * 1.Target Male Shoppers
# 
# * Since male customers account for a significant portion of Black Friday sales and tend to spend more per transaction on average, Walmart should tailor its marketing strategies and product offerings to incentivize higher spending among male customers while ensuring competitive pricing for female-oriented products.
# 
# * 2. Focus on 26 - 45 Age Group
# 
# * With the age group between 26 and 45 contributing to the majority of sales, Walmart should specifically cater to the preferences and needs of this demographic.This could include offering exclusive deals on products that are popular among this age group.
# 
# * 3. Engage Younger Shoppers
# 
# * Knowing that customers in the 0 - 17 age group have the lowest spending per transaction, Walmart can try to increase their spending per transaction by offering them more attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs. It's essential to start building brand loyalty among younger consumers.
# 
# * 4. Customer Segmentation
# 
# * Since customers in the 18 - 25, 26 - 35, and 46 - 50 age groups exhibit similar buying characteristics, and so do the customers in 36 - 45 and 55+, Walmart can optimize its product selection to cater to the preferences of these age groups. Also, Walmart can use this information to adjust their pricing strategies for different age groups.
# 
# * 5. Enhance the 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience
# 
# *  Considering that customers aged 51 - 55 have the highest spending per transaction, Walmart offer them exclusive pre-sale access, special discount or provide personalized product recommendations for this age group. Walmart can also introduce loyalty programs specifically designed to reward and retain customers in the 51 - 55 age group.
# 
# * 6. Post-Black Friday Engagement
# 
# * After Black Friday, walmart should engage with customers who made purchases by sending follow-up emails or offers for related products. This can help increase customer retention and encourage repeat business throughout the holiday season and beyond.
